  <h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Gustavo. This site serves as my professional home online. 
Below you'll find my cover letter and links to my work.</p>

  <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
  <p>I’m a software development technologist with a passion for learning and exploring how technology intersects with mathematics and science. I love building and experimenting with new ideas, from machine learning to quantum computing. Inspired by the curiosity of science fiction writers like Asimov and Bradbury, my goal is to grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and keep expanding my knowledge while working on cutting-edge tech.</p>
